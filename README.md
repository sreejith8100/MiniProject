<h1> Read this document before using the code </h1>
This project uses an open source library called pbPlots for plotting 2-D graphs using C programming. To read more about pbPlots, <a href = https://github.com/InductiveComputerScience/pbPlots> click here</a>.
To use the code, either clone the repository using git clone, or copy the code from each file and create a new project in codeblocks or any other IDEs. There is a makefile already created and if any changes are made to the names of the file, please update those names in the makefile too.
The main code is in the file called <a href = https://github.com/sreejith8100/MiniProject/blob/main/example1.c >example1.c</a>. It still has some flaws and is not completely working. But try changing the values of h and see how the output looks for 1msec. There are some further instructions in the code itself as comments.
